# What is the Webinterface?

The Webinterface is split up into two parts a Frontend and Backend.

## Backend

It handles the logic related to Database communications and Session management.\
Ours is developed in Java Springboot.

## Frontend

This is the actual website you will visit and use since it will give you a visual overview of managing all the settings.\
It's made in Svelte.
