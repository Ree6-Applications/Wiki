# Self host with Pterodactyl

Before we start you will need the Ree6 Egg!\
You can get it from [here](https://github.com/pelican-eggs/chatbots/tree/main/discord/ree6)\
After importing the Egg into your Pterodactyl Interface you will need to configurate your egg via Pterodactyl before running it.\
All the required configurations should be marked as required by Pterodactyl.\


## Note

If you want to self host Ree6 instead of using Pterodactyl visit [.](./ "mention").
