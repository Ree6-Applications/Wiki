# Plugin System

## What is this system?

This system allows you to develop your own expansions which we call "plugins", and distribute them to your liking, while still following the license. With this, you have general compatibility with different forks of Ree6, since you don't need to change the forks code to work with the plugin system.

## What is the difference between the Addon and Plugin System?

They are two different implementations of the same Idea. The Addon System was developed by us to allow the creation of expansions, sadly that fully broke down after we switched to Java 17. And with v4 we decided to change to a framework that handles all the management stuff.
