# Installing Plugins

## Where do I put my plugins?

Once you have started Ree6 it should create a folder called plugins, just put them in there!

## Do I need to restart the bot?

We recommend a restart if you want to load a new plugin, but you can also use the `/addon load` command to load the plugin without a restart. If you encounter any Issues try restarting the bot and see if they persist.
